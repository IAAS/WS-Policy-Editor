WS-Policy-Editor is a Java-Swing-based Editor for [WS-Policies](http://www.w3.org/TR/ws-policy/).

It supports normalizing, union, and intersection of WS-Policies. Custom assertions may be included by adding new Java classes.

An old version of [Apache Neethi](http://ws.apache.org/neethi/) is used as basis for the implementation of the algorithms.
